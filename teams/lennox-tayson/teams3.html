    <hr>
        when we were first dicusing on what we should do with this bridge 
        we wanted to change our design to be an arch bridge.
        <hr>
        we wanted to do this because after putting all of the info together and learningf all about bridges we thought that the arch would be the best option.
        <hr>
        after all of that we realised that the arch would be super heavy and that is what lost us the competition last time so we stuck to our currunt design but planing on making it lighter.
        <hr>
        
        <h3> what we changed</h3>
        <hr>
       for the 3rd bridge, like i said we are going to try to make it lighter by making all of the tension spots
        only 2 srands of spaghetti.
        <p>
        
        </p>
        in other words every single spot on the bridge that is under tension, is getting baccically pulled apart
        when a load force goes on the top of the bridge.
        <p>
        so, by what we leard from the start of this project, spots that are under tension do not 
        need as much spaghetti meening we do not have to add as much. when doing that it will also make the bridge lighter wich is exactly what we want.
