    It was a very narrow bridge.

    <h3>Measurments:</h3>
     <hr {width: 22px;}>
        <h4> -Length: 60cm </h4>
        <div> <h4>-Height: 20cm </h4></div> 
      <div> <h4>-Width: 5cm</h4> </div> 
      <div> Our thoughts were that if we had a thin bridge we would have leftover spagetti for extra support.  
For the next test we have lots of new ideas and strategies to make test #2 better than the last. </div>

<div><h3> Problem</h3></div>
     <hr {width: 22px;}>

<p><span style="background-color: #debbea">-Off balance / too tippy</span> <div> </div> </p>
<span style="background-color: #debbea"> -Not wide enough </span>
 <div> <h3> Results </h3></div>
     <hr {width: 22px;}>
Sadly our bridge broke while we were finishing it up on the day of the crushing.

<div> <h3>Reflections and improvement </h3></div>


     <hr {width: 22px;}>
We have definitely learnt that wide bridges are better than narrow.
<div> Making sure the top is leveled </div>
 <div> Most of all we will try to avoid getting disqualifyed </div>
