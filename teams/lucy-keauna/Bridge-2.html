                 - Measurements: width-10, height-15, & lenght-61.<div>
               </div>
               - Our second bridge held 6.1lbs (2.8kg) 8th place.
               <h2> Problem </h2>
                   Our main problem was that we didn't have cross bracing through the middle, so the spaghetti on both sides broke in half.  But every thing else was intact.
                 We got Disqauilfyed because our length was not exactly 60cm long it was 61cm!
               - Our second bridge held 6.1lbs (2.8kg) 8th place.
<div> <h3>Reflections And Improvements </h3></div>
                <hr {width: 22px;}>
                 <p> To improve our design we will create a triangle pattern through the middle to act as support. Instead of having all the bunches 6cm we will make the outside layer of the frame 8 and the inside, top and bottom 5cm
